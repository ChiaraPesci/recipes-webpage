	          Tortelli are taking quite some time to prepare because you need first to take care of the filling, then prepare the pasta dough as described above and finally assemble them. My advice is to prepare the filling the day before and leave it to rest in the fridge for 24 hours so all the different tastes can nicely mix together. To prepare the filling put in a bowl spinach, ricotta, Parmigiano, nutmeg and mix. If the mixture seems to be too soft you can add a bit of grated parmigiano (this will also give a stronger taste) or a bit of bread crumbs. Taste it and add salt if necessary. Set your pasta machine, ...

        Hi! My name is Chiara, I am an Engineer and currently a PhD student. <br>
        I am Italian, but I am living in Germany since three years...one of the things that I miss the most from my country is the <em><b>Food</b></em>!!<br>
        After I left Italy, my cooking skills definitely improved, trying to reproduce all the nice homemade dishes that I am used to eat at home.<br> 
        I really love to spend my free time cooking...fresh pasta (when I have a LOT of free time), pizza, bread and cakes, mostly chocolate cakes ;-)<br>
        In this page I am collecting some easy recipes from my province, Mantova, and/or typically Italian or just that I like.<br> 
        Feel free to try them and have a lot of fun cooking!!
