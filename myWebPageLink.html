	        <h5 class="procedure"> Procedure </h5>
	        <p>
	          Put the flour on a wooden board and create a deep well in the middle of the flour. Crack the eggs into this well and start to whisk the eggs with the fork. As you whisk the eggs, begin gradually pulling in the flour from the sides of the well. Keep mixing till you finish the flour, then start mixing the dough with the hands, till it becomes nicely smooth. If the dough is too soft or sticky you can add a little bit of flour. This can happen because the size of the eggs is not standard and not all the flours are the same (the gluten content vary from one to the other). Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes in a covered bowl or wrapped in the kitchen plastic film. Now you can create all the fresh pasta that you want!

        Hi! My name is Chiara, I am an Engineer and currently a PhD student. <br>
        I am Italian, but I am living in Germany since three years...one of the things that I miss the most from my country is the <em><b>Food</b></em>!!<br>
        After I left Italy, my cooking skills definitely improved, trying to reproduce all the nice homemade dishes that I am used to eat at home.<br> 
        I really love to spend my free time cooking...fresh pasta (when I have a LOT of free time), pizza, bread and cakes, mostly chocolate cakes ;-)<br>
        In this page I am collecting some easy recipes from my province, Mantova, and/or typically Italian or just that I like.<br> 
        Feel free to try them and have a lot of fun cooking!!
